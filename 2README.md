# Intro

Welcome to my map of Fareham, England.  This project is built with Yarn and React.js.  This is project 7 of 7 in Udacity's Front End NanoDegree.  myjson.com is used for the third-party API, which provides the array of places of interest.  This is a json file I gathered by researching various sources including MediaWiki and Google Maps.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


# Instructions

Download from https://github.com/QAMinn2468/p7.  On the command line, in the program folder, type: 'yarn install' then 'yarn start'.  This will open a local server on your browser where you may view the project.


# A11y

My first step was to set the language to British English.  It just makes sense to have ChromeVox announce British place names with a British accent.
